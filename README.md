Periodic solution of 3bp (with 3equal masses under gravitational field)
 The Newtonian approach is followed to write down the differential equations and Runge-Kutta 4th-order numerical method is used to approximate this motion. Unlike periodic two-body motion, collisionless periodic solutions of Newtonsâ€™s equations governing the motion of three celestial bodies around their common center of mass are not known analytically for arbitrary initial conditions. With the advent of computers, numerical solutions have been found. here, Moore-Cheniciner-Montgomery-Simo "figure eight" family is plotted.
